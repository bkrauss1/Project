  <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
  <p>
      My website is about running and injury prevention.
  </p>
  <h2>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h2>
<p>
    The objctive of this website is to create awareness and provide information for injury prevention targeted towards runners. This is important for all types of runners, and I think it would be helpful to have post-run information.
</p>
<h2>Who is your target audience set?</h2>
<p>
    The target audience for this website is runners of all levels. From beginners to college athletes, I want to provide helpful information that applies to all runners of different skill levels.
</p>
<h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
<p>
I plan to have a stretching page, injury- recovery page, helpful running tips and tricks, and healthy habits page as the main content of this website.
</p>
<h2>As you think through your website, please remember that the website must have at least 4 pages of content besides the homepage, sitemap, and contact/feedback pages.</h2>
